Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. The purpose of the analysis is, to create a binary classifier by using machine learning and neural networks, on the dataset's features that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Four jupyter files are starting from initial AlphabetSoupCharity to 3AlphabetSoupCharity and also there are 4 HDF5 files all stored in the repository. 
The initial jupyter notebook has the basic model and the other 3 jupyter files have optimization attempts with different alterations of hidden layers, neurons, features, and so on. A detailed Report has been attached explaining every step related to the process. 

### In the third attempt, an accuracy of 78% has been achieved.
